        <p>Education: So I graduated from Ghana Telecom University in 2016 with a degree in Computer Engineering, I still don't look like an engineer though, unless of-course I sit behind my computer with a helmet!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <p>Work: I did my national service at Ridge Hospital for a year in their ICT department. I had a good time there trust me. I was doing big things back there. LOL. Still doing big things, thats why I'm still there.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <p>Why did I decide to take a programming class? Hmmmm, let me wear my Einstein glasses. Well as a computer engineer you need to know a bit of coding and whatever I learned in school hasn't be used for about a year now so I decided to take this so
          as to polish my skills.</p>
